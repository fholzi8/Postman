# Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco FMC REST API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection, as DevNet only has
a single FMC sandbox today. It is long-lived instance, so please be
responsible and clean up after yourself by deleting all objects you create.
  * `reservable`: Contains public hostname for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable FMC instance, which requires a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize. Several other variables are templated
    but must be replaced with custom credentials, domain IDs, and more.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.

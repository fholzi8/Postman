# Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco FTD REST API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection, as DevNet only has
a single FTD sandbox today.
  * `reservable`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable FTD instance, which requires a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
